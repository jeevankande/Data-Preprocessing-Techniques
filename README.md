Data Preprocessing Techniques
In this processes we are trying to handle missing valuses, outliers.
Applying scaling because in case of classification where we mostly use distance methods like eulclidean distances or manhatten dustances in that case it reuires more computational efforts
We handled here data which is not normally distributed so we need to transform this kind of data base on kurtosis or skewness of data
